# MyReads

This project was built for Udacity's React and Front End 
NanoDegree Programs. This 6th project is a bookshelf app that allows 
the user to select and categorize books that he/she has read, are currently reading, or want to read. The projects purpose is to
demonstrate understanding of the basic structure and operation of a React
based app. The project provided an API server and client library that is used to persist information as the user interacts with the application. 

## Instructions

## Required for installation
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

To get started:
* Download or clone the repo and cd into the project folder
* Run `npm install` to install all the project dependencies
* Then `npm start` to start the application server

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
